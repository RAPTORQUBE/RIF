\section{Introduction}
The demand for processing data into knowledge is exponentially increasing as new raw data sources appear and the volume of data they generate increases daily. The conversion of data into actionable knowledge is important for the future of modern society. Every aspect of our lives ranging from health care to shopping are now impacted by our ability to process more data per person per day. 
The increase of volume, variety, velocity and veracity is a major challenge to data scientists.
The volume can nolonger get processed on a single storage system device and now need to be spread over multiple systems. 
The variety introduce complexity in the processing as the systems now need to consolidate more data on same real world object. 
The speed or velocity of data creation is demanding more processing every second of the day. 
The veracity of the data requires that extra quality checks on data.
The trend over the last years is to build bigger and bigger data centers with massive energy requirements. This trend can not be sustain worldwide. Energy costs money and consumes natural resources that is getting more scares.

\textbf{\textit{Research goal is more processing capasity with less energy.}}
\section{Background}
The research is into Heterogeneous Computing using Parallel patterns.
\subsection{Heterogeneous Computing}
Heterogeneous computing systems [11] uses more than one type of processors. Systems gain performance enhancements by the ability to utilise dissimilar processors to execute common processing requirements. Using central processing unit (\textit{CPU}), graphical processing unit (\textit{GPU}) and field-programmable gate array (\textit{FPGA}) processor that performs the required effective processing at low energy requirements.
The research evaluates \textit{"What parallel patterns requires ... What combination of Heterogeneous Computing?"}. The central processing unit (\textit{CPU}) is designed with few cores optimised for sequential serial processing patterns that requires large amounts of control changes. The graphical processing unit (\textit{GPU}) is designed as a massively parallel architecture of thousands of smaller, efficient cores handling multiple tasks simultaneously. The spesilised Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\textit{ASIC}) solution is capable of performing fixed spesific tasks like network connectivity, mapping information. Field-Programmable Gate Array (\textit{FPGA}) is a set of programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications. 
\subsection{Parallel Patterns}
Patterns is the fundimental programming building blocks of data processing requirement. Heterogeneous computing changes the design and implimentation of common parallel patterns (task parallelism, pipelines, recursive splitting and geometric decomposition of data processing). We investigate new knowledge-extraction patterns using common strategies (actors, shared queue, fork/join, loop parallelism and master/worker) with libraries (CUDA [7], OpenCL[5][8][9][13], FastFlow [6] and ZeroMQ [10]).
\subsection{Efficiency and Energy-awareness}
The increasing drive for processing power demand increase energy levels to perform tasks. Our research targets efficiency in terms of processing time, programming effort, energy-awareness for each design pattern. Research calculates efficiency of processing in Floating-point Operations Per Second per Watt (\textit{FLOP/S/W}). 
\subsection{Research Information Factory}
The Research Information Factory (\textit{RIF}) is a processing appliance consisting of a framework and a cluster that supports the conversion of raw research data into knowledge using parallel patterns. 
\subsubsection{RIF Framework}
The Research Information Factory Framework (\textit{RIFF}) is a data processing framework that was designed 
during the period 2006 to 2011 and officially published as part of a MSc in Business Intelligence project (2012) and adapted during a Pg Cert in Data Science (2013) [15] to support unstructured and structured data patterns.  
The framework contains a set of guidelines to process data into knowledge. 
Framework uses a five layer process Research Layer (spesific research requirements), Utility Layer (common processing utilities), Audit, Balance and Control Layer (schedule jobs, collect audits, control patterns)
Operational Management Layer (active processing controls) Functional Layer supports the core processing pattern of \textbf{R}etrieve-\textbf{A}ssess-\textbf{P}rocess-\textbf{T}ransform-\textbf{O}rganise-\textbf{R}eport (\textit{R-A-P-T-O-R}).

\subsubsection{RIF Cluster}
The Research Information Factory Cluster (\textit{RIFC}) is a 3D torus connected cluster appliance using commondity computer equipment to process the RIFF parallel patterns. This new custom parallel cluster appliance design [15] (Synaptic Assimilator) supports the RIFF. The cluster supports a Cassandra database [2] and a Spark Processing Engine [12] to handle the scalability and high availability data processing to match the parallel patterns requirements for data sources of a size larger than what a single system can handle.
\section{Proposed Solution}
The reearch will develop new parallel patterns for knowledge extraction, new mechanisms for storing and extracting data while using minimum amounts of energy.
The research over next year covers three stages:
\subsection{Heterogeneous systems.}
The research will study the fundamental behavior of a selection of heterogeneous computing components as implimented in a nVidia Jetson TK1 development kit. [4]
\subsection{Parallel patterns for data processing}
The behavior is evaluated on a basis of a fixed size data set processed via a spesific parallel pattern changing parameters like combinations of CPU, GPU with different clock speeds, memory allocations and measuring time to complete task, energy requirements and effort in amount of code required for each parallel pattern and heterogeneous computing combination. 
\subsection{Research Information Factory Cluster}
The Research Information Factory Cluster (\textit{RIFC}) is a 3D torus connected cluster appliance using commondity computer equipment, a Cassandra database [2] and a Spark Engine [12] to handle the scalability and high availability data processing from systems like nVidia Jetson TK1 [4] and Tilera TILE-Mx100 processor [14].
\section{Conclusion}
The research goal is to do more processing with less energy. Heterogeneous systems with parallel patterns is currently the optimum option to acheve the goal.
