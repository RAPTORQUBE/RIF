\section{Introduction}

The Rapid Information Factory is a data processing architecture that enables the enhanced processing of data by using a structured and highly optimised parallel processing framework.

The core of the framework is a processing pipeline with feedback to enhance the processing of the the data into information.

Our research covers the structure of this processing framework and the use of a three node Beowulf cluster \cite{sonzogni2002parallel} that combines into the formation of the Rapid Information Factory.

The improve the performance of the factory we apply same Lean Six Sigma \cite{george2005lean} rules that applies to normal manufacturing factories with proven success.

\section{Rapid Information Factory}

The factory is a singular processing solution that processes all data into information using a XML based rules.

The solution consists of an interaction between three dimensional frameworks:

\subsection{Customer Framework}
This is the view the single view of the information to the customer. It is structured to show the information in the view the customer spesifies in the functional requirements. As for this research paper is not further expanded or discussed.
\subsection{Project Framework} 
The factory evolves over time as it is developed and then redeveloped to handle extra enhancements or new data sources. The project is driven by a agile project methodology consisting a backlog and a cycle of five day sprints covering a period of six months. As for the research this is not expanded or discussed.

\subsection{Rapid Information Factory Framework}
The framework consists of a five high-level layers:

\subsubsection{Business Layer}

The Business Layer contains the Business spesific framework configurations that covers either functional requirements or non-functional requirements.

The layer consists of two groupings:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Functional
  \item Non-functional
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Utility Layer}
The Untility Layer consists of sets of utilities for the overall factory.

The layer consists of two groupings of utilities:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Maintance utilities
  \item General utilities
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Audit, Balance and Control Layer}

The Audit, Balance and Control Layer (ABC) is the layer that supports the factory while it is running.
This layer handles any active processing allowcated to the Beowulf engine.

The layer consists of three groupings.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Audit
  \item Balance
  \item Control
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Operational Management Layer}

The Operational Management Layer supports setup of the individual job definition and 
interaction between jobs, job parameters, scheduling, monitoring, communication and alerting within the factory.

The layer is the central management engine of the factory. 

The layer consists of five groupings:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Jobs
  \item Schedule
  \item Monitor
  \item Communication
  \item Alerts
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Functional Layer}
The functional layer store the scripts that describes every functional process of the complete factory.

The layer consists of six groupings of jobs:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Retrieve
  \item Assess
  \item Process
  \item Transform
  \item Organise
  \item Report
\end{enumerate}
