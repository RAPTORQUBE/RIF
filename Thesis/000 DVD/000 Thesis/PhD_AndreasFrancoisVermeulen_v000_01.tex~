\section{Rapid Information Factory (RIF)}
\subsection{Rapid Information Factory Framework (RIFF)}
\paragraph{The rapid information factory framework is a methodology, the result of research since 2008 , designed to guide a exascale \cite{bergman2008exascale} heterogeneous computing cluster to process a exabyte data lake. The framework will processes a quintillion calculations per second against quintillion bytes of disk storage. The framework generates a series of virtual factories that together process the data lake using enhanced custom designed parallel processes.}
\subsubsection{Functional Layer}
The functional layer handles the all functional processes within the cluster.
The functions is build to empower the factory to process data sources in a predictable and repeatable series of processes.
This layer is the bulk of the framework, as it contains the main components of the factory process and will expand as the factory deploys into full production.
\paragraph{\textbf{High-Level View}}
\paragraph{The high-level view of the Homogeneous Ontology for Recursive Uniform Schema (HORUS) shows the users the current status of the rapid information factory. This is achieve by visualisation of the rapid information factory via a Rstudio Shiny \cite{ortega2013combining} and R \cite{team2000r} based web site. The complete state of the factories are online in a graph database.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Synaptic Assimilator (SA)}}
\paragraph{The synaptic assimilator (SA) is an artificial intelligence \cite{o2013artificial} engine that performs the processes assigned to the system to the most effective and efficient method.}
\paragraph{The artificial intelligence uses machine learning as an investigation and testing method to improve and select the correct combination of processing artifacts to achieve the efficient and effective outcome of each factory process.}
\paragraph{The engine is taught data science and performance improvement processes to enables it to manage the factories to process the data sources it is supplied with for processing.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Exascale Data Lake}}
\paragraph{The exascale data lake is a data source that exceeds a quintillion bytes. The data source holds structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The synaptic assimilator converts it into a base deep learning data source by applying the appropriate functions and data processing patterns.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Persistent Recursive Information Schema Manipulator (PRISM)}}
\paragraph{The persistent recursive information schema manipulator is the central control framework for each data procesing flow through the system using a bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) abstract computer as a bridging model for rapid information factory's parallel algorithms, that are pre-defined and tested by each factory.}
\paragraph{\textbf{RAPTOR Supersteps}}
\paragraph{The RAPTOR framework is the basis for the six supersteps of the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) based process. The framework uses fundamental building blocks like pipeline, farm and loopback to formulate more complex structures to handle the data requirements within each of the six supersteps.}
\paragraph{The six supersteps are:}
\paragraph{\textbf{Retrieve Superstep}}
\paragraph{The retrieve superstep is responsible for data retrieval from other data sources into the data lake. \textit{(See Retrieve Superstep for more details)}}
\paragraph{\textbf{Assess Superstep}}
\paragraph{The assess superstep is responsible for the data validation in the active factory. Data Quality is determined and also improved where possible in this super step.\textit{(See Assess Superstep for more details)}}
\paragraph{\textbf{Process Superstep}}
\paragraph{The process superstep is responsible for the processing of the dark data in the data lake into a structured data vault. The data vault keeps full record of the different phases that the data is process over time.\textit{(See Process Superstep for more details)}}
\paragraph{\textbf{Transform Superstep}}
\paragraph{The transform superstep is responsible for transforming the data vault into an enterprise data warehouse. This superstep tranforms the data into knowledge by adding dimensionality and insight to the data vault.\textit{(See Transform Superstep for more details)}}
\paragraph{\textbf{Organise Superstep}}
\paragraph{The organise superstep is responsible for organising the data sets together for each business grouping from the data warehose into data marts.\textit{(See Organise Superstep for more details)}}
\paragraph{\textbf{Report Superstep}}
\paragraph{The report superstop is responsible to perform the required reporting and analytic requirements.\textit{(See Report Superstep for more details)}}
\subsubsection{Operational Management Layer}
\paragraph{The operational mangement layer is responsible to handle all the arctifacts required by the factory to perform the required processing requirements. It also bounds the factory to only be able to perform functions the layer already manages.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Autonomous Node Transport (ANT) Definitions}}
\paragraph{The autonomous node transport definitions are the set of cloud instances or physical servers configurations supporting the processing capability of the factory. The HORUS schema keeps a series of characteristics required by the factory to decide which autonomous node transport to use for which requirement. The nodes will be changed in the future as characteristics for new nodes are discovered and loaded into the factory.}
\paragraph{The nodes are heterogeneous computing enabled and support combinations of heterogeneous processors that covers the range from high-end servers and high-performance computing machines to low-power embedded devices like mobile phones and tablets.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Autonomous Node Transport Management}}
\paragraph{The autonomous node transport management oversees the complete process of running the heterogeneous computing systems. The combinations and work flow of the nodes is pre-defined in this section.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Monitoring}}
\paragraph{Monitoring handles the monitoring tasks in the system. The monitoring covers all aspects of the factory's performance.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Persistent Uniform Protocol Agreement (PUPA) Definitions}}
\paragraph{The persistent uniform protocol agreement definitions are the collection of the algorithmic skeletons within the system.The PUPAs are programs generate using existing frameworks like OpenCL \cite{stone2010opencl}, ArrayFire \cite{malcolm2012arrayfire}, Spark \cite{hintjens2011omq}, Titan graph database \cite{tanase2014highly} \cite{mishra2014titan}, FastFlow Framework \cite{aldinucci2011accelerating}. This is the main area of research for the team. The enhancement and creation of new parallel patterns will improve the capasity of the synaptic assimilator to build new factories and process the data into knowledge.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Persistent Uniform Protocol Agreement (PUPA) Management}}
\paragraph{The persistent uniform protocol agreement management oversees the complete collection. The process ensures that all uniform protocol agreements are manange to achieve the required end goal of the factory to effectively and efficently process data into knowledge.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Alerting}}
\paragraph{The alerts are manage from this singular point in the system. The alerting process interacts with the communication process to ensure the appropriate response is generated for the alerts.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Parameters}}
\paragraph{The parameters are stored in this singular place in the system. Managing the parameters in a single location enhance sthe factory to adapt to changing requirements in a rapid time.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Scheduling}}
\paragraph{The scheduling handles the schedules from this singular point in the system.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Communication}}
\paragraph{Communication handles the communication into and from the system from this singular point.}
\subsubsection{Audit, Balance and Control Layer}
\paragraph{\textbf{Work Cells}}
\paragraph{The work cells \cite{feld2000lean} is the fundamental building block of the processing system.}
\paragraph{The work cell is executing as an actor model (a mathematical model of concurrent computation) that use "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation: in response to a message it receives, an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to message received.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Execution Statistics}}
\paragraph{The execution statistics is the fundamental performance recording system for the factory in the solution.}
\paragraph{\textbf{Remote Yoke}}
\paragraph{The Yoke or Poka-yoke is fundamental process of "mistake-proofing". The Remote York is the rapid information factory's fundamental monitoring interface between the different work cells. }
\paragraph{\textbf{Rejections and Error Handling}}
\paragraph{The rejections and error handling in the rapid information factory handles the rejections and error handling within the system.}
\paragraph{Balancing and Control}
\paragraph{The balance and control mechanisms are the execute from the singular section.}
\paragraph{Codes Management}
\paragraph{The code management is the single section that holds the standard codes used in the system.}
\paragraph{Standard codes includes ISO codes, pre-agreed names and known lists of items for the factory.}
\paragraph{Example of the ISO standards used are:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ISO 3166 - Country Codes of the world}
\item{ISO 4217 - Currency Codes of the world}
\item{ISO 6709 - Representation of latitude, longitude and altitude for geographic point locations.}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{The use of standard codes enable the effective deep data mining prescribed as output of the factory.}
\subsubsection{Business Layer}
\paragraph{Functional Requirements}
\paragraph{A functional requirement defines a function of a system and its components. A function is described as a set of inputs, the behavior, and outputs. \cite{roman1985taxonomy}. The set of requirements together as a unit describes the factory processing rules.}
\paragraph{Non-functional Requirements}
\paragraph{A non-functional requirement is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to test the operation of a factory, rather than specific behaviors of the process within the factory.The set of requirements together as a unit describes the factory verification rules.}

\section{Improvement Processes}
\subsection{The 8 Wastes}
\subsubsection{Defects.}
\paragraph{Defects are mistakes that require extra time, resources and money to reprocess.}
\paragraph{The defects are the result of:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Poor quality control of processes (ANTs, PUPAs).
\item Poor repairs on servers.
\item Poor documentation procedures in HORUS.
\item Lack of standards in HORUS.
\item Weak or missing processes (ANTs, PUPAs).
\item A misunderstanding of customer requirements.
\item Poor inventory control (ANTs, PUPAs and Data Lake).
\item Poor design of processes (ANTs, PUPAs and Data Lake).
\item Undocumented design changes (ANTs, PUPAs and Data Lake).
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Overproduction.}
\paragraph{Overproduction is when too many of a spesific deliverable is delivered.}
\paragraph{The factory would cause overproduction if too many ANTs is prepared for running PUPAs:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Just-in-case production, processing data without needing it.
\item Unclear customer requirements, RAPTOR PUPA's process defective data.
\item Producing to a incorrect forecast, processing is done at incorrect time.
\item Long set-up times, ANTs take to long to start-up ready for processing.
\item Attempts to avoid long set-up times, leaving ANT's running just incase they are needed.
\item Poorly applied automation, the process does not perform as required. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Waiting}
\paragraph{Actual downtime that occurs whenever processing has to stop for an unplanned/planned reason.}
\paragraph{Causes of waiting can also include:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mismatched production rates, data arrives too early or too late.
\item Very long set-up times, ANT's take too long to be ready for processing.
\item Poor RAPTOR workflow, design to workflow for optimum throughput.
\item Insufficient staffing, when human intervention is need it has to be ready at correct time.
\item Work absences, if the data is dependent on human intervention to complete a task then absences will cause waiting.
\item Poor communications, if the yokes loses communication the process will cause waiting or lack of synchronisation.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Non-Utilised Talent}
\paragraph{Non-Utilised Talent is the poor utilization of available talents, ideas, abilities and skill sets.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lack of teamwork between staff members.
\item Lack of training in operations of the factory.
\item Poor communications between staff members and the factory.
\item Management's refusal to include employees in problem-solving.
\item Narrowly defined jobs and expectations for staff.
\item Poor management of staff.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Transportation}
\paragraph{Transportation is the unnecessary moving data around within the factory.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Poor factory layout via HORUS.
\item Excessive or unnecessary handling of data via PUPAs.
\item Misaligned process flow in the factory via HORUS.
\item Poorly-designed factory PUPAs via HORUS.
\item Unnecessary steps in factory PUPA processes via HORUS.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Inventory}
\paragraph{Lean are based on the practice of Just-In-Time production of data in the factory.}
\paragraph{Excess inventory is caused by:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Overproduction.
\item Poor layout.
\item Mismatched production speeds.
\item Unreliable suppliers of data.
\item Long set-up times of ANTs.
\item Misunderstood customer requirements.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Motion}
\paragraph{Excess motion is to move around too much and then causes the factory slow down significantly.}
\paragraph{Causes of excessive motion include:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Poor work cell and workflow in the RAPTOR flow.
\item Poor housekeeping of ANT's recycle process.
\item Shared ANT and PUPA processing.
\item Work cell congestion
\item Isolated operations in PUPA.
\item Lack of standards in PUPA.
\item Poor process design and controls of PUPA.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Extra-processing}
\paragraph{Excess Processing is any unnecessary effort expended in order to complete a task: double-handling data, seeking permission during processing, unnecessary processing steps, unnecessary data useage, re-entering data, making too many copies of data.}
\paragraph{Excess Processing arises from:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Poor process control of the RAPTOR flow via HORUS.
\item Lack of standards in PUPA.
\item Poor communication between yoke and PRISM.
\item Overdesigned equipment for ANT requirements.
\item Misunderstanding of the customer's requirements via HORUS.
\item Human error.
\item Producing to forecast not requirement by factory via HORUS.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Plan-Do-Act-Check Improvement Process}
\subsubsection{Plan}
\paragraph{Establish the objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with the expected output (the target or goals). By establishing output expectations, the completeness and accuracy of the specifications is also a part of the targeted improvement. When possible start on a small scale to test possible effects.}
\subsubsection{Do}
\paragraph{Implement the plan, execute the process, execute the factory. Collect data for charting and analysis in the following "CHECK" and "ACT" steps.}
\subsubsection{Check}
\paragraph{Study the actual results (measured and collected in "DO" above) and compare against the expected results (targets or goals from the "PLAN") to ascertain any differences. Look for deviation in implementation from the plan and also look for the appropriateness and completeness of the plan to enable the execution, i.e., "Do". Charting data can make this much easier to see trends over several PDCA cycles and in order to convert the collected data into information. Information is what you need for the next step "ACT".}
\subsubsection{Act}
\paragraph{If the CHECK shows that the PLAN that was implemented in DO is an improvement to the prior standard (baseline), then that becomes the new standard (baseline) for how the factory should ACT going forward (new standards are enACTed). If the CHECK shows that the PLAN that was implemented in DO is not an improvement, then the existing standard (baseline) will remain in place. In either case, if the CHECK showed something different than expected (whether better or worse), then there is more learning to be done and that will suggest potential future PDCA cycles. Note that some who teach PDCA assert that the ACT involves making adjustments or corrective actions. It is a repeating process that improves the factory.}
\subsection{Define-Measure-Analyse-Improve-Control Improvement Process}
\subsubsection{Define}
\paragraph{The purpose of this step is to clearly articulate the business problem, goal, potential resources, project scope and high-level project timeline. This information is typically captured within project charter document.}
\subsubsection{Measure}
\paragraph{The purpose of this step is to objectively establish current baselines as the basis for improvement. This is a data collection step, the purpose of which is to establish process performance baselines.}
\subsubsection{Analyse}
\paragraph{The purpose of this step is to identify, validate and select root cause for elimination.}
\subsubsection{Improve}
\paragraph{The purpose of this step is to identify, test and implement a solution to the problem; in part or in whole.}
\subsubsection{Control}
\paragraph{The purpose of this step is to sustain the gains. Monitor the improvements to ensure continued and sustainable success. Create a control plan.}
\subsection{Lean Six Sigma: 5S}
\subsubsection{Sort}
\paragraph{The first step is to go through all equipment (ANTs and PUPAs) and data in the factory and determine what must be retained in the factory. Only essential PRISMs, ANTs and PUPA are allowed to remain. Archive any unwanted entities.}
\subsubsection{Set in Order}
\paragraph{“A place for everything, and everything in its place.” }
\paragraph{Work through the HORUS structures and ensure all the PRISMs, ANTs and PUPAs are in correct workflows. Use a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to ensure the workflow has a logical start and end. Simulate the process to run through without data to verify the factory before processing happens.}
\subsubsection{Shine}
\paragraph{Monitor and maintain the processes the synaptic assimilator setup in HORUS, thoroughly clean everything remaining in the factories.Ensure effective and efficient execution of PRISMs, ANTs and PUPAs in the factories.}
\subsubsection{Standardise}
\paragraph{Make factories consistent. All PRISMs and PUPAs should be identical so that any ANTs can immediately get initialise and productively execute the process if necessary.}
\subsubsection{Systematise}
\paragraph{This final step means to attach a schedule to use the 5S-ed factory flows.}
