\section{Research Question}
Can a Rapid Information Factory using agile lean six sigma principles solve the effective and efficient exascale heterogeneous computing based processing of a million terabytes data lake into a value-add deep learning knowledge source?
\section{Rapid Information Factory}
\subsection{Rapid Information Factory Framework}
The rapid information factory framework is a methodology that guides a exascale \cite{bergman2008exascale} heterogeneous computing cluster to process a exascale data lake. The framework uses billion billion calculations per second against one million terabytes of disk storage. The framework generates a series of factories that together can process the data lake using custom designed parallel processes.

The functional layer is the area that handles the functional processes within the cluster.
This layer is the bulk of the framework as it contains the main components of the process.

\subsection{Rapid Information Factory Data Sources}
\subsubsection{Retrieve Data Sources}
\paragraph{The retrieve data sources are external data source that requires a spesial type of persistent uniform protocol agreement called a node extractor and schema transformer that supplies the data processing instructions to transform the extraernal data into HORUS compliant data structures. The additional data workspace supplies preloaded data to assist the retrieve superstep to load the data from the external data source to create the retrieve data workspace that is the main storage structure in HORUS any retrieve data loads.}
\subsubsection{Assess Data Sources}
\paragraph{The assess data sources are a read only input from the retrieve data workspace, a reference data workspace that is a read only data source for supplying reference data for the assess procudures.Reference data can iclude lists of codes and description that are valid data or lookup data to enhance the quality of the data by adding extra information to the assess data. The assess data workspace is the main storage structure for HORUS data.}

\paragraph{The process data sources are a read only input from the assess data workspace, a reference data workspace that is a read only data source for supplying reference data for the process procudures.Reference data can iclude lists of codes and description that are valid data or lookup data to enhance the quality of the data by adding extra information to the process data. The process data workspace is the main storage structure for HORUS data processed into a data vault containing hubs, links and satellites. }
\subsubsection{Data Vault}
\paragraph{The Data Vault architecture offers a unique solution to data integration in the rapid information factory. The Data Vault is a detail oriented, historical tracking and uniquely linked set of normalised tables that support one or more functional areas of the factory that stores perfeactly as data island on top of the data lake structure to process unstructured and semi-structured data into structured data.}
